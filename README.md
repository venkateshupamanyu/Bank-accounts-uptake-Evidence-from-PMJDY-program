# Bank-accounts-uptake-Evidence-from-PMJDY-program
The research project provides empirical evidence from India's PMJDY program, a large supply
shock that gives bank accounts to all of its 280 million unbanked population.
Proprietary data from individual bank account statements shows that there is
signicant uptake, usage, usage growth, and balance accumulation in PMJDY
accounts. Activity levels increase over time and converge towards those in
non-PMJDY accounts although PMJDY account holders are poorer, unfamiliar
with banking, and undergo no literacy training. The results suggest that
the 2 billion unbanked around the world have unmet demand for banking or
that banking supply can stimulate its own demand.
