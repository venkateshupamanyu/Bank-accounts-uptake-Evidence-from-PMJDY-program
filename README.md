# Bank-accounts-uptake-Evidence-from-PMJDY-program
The research project provides empirical evidence from India's PMJDY program, a large supply
shock that gives bank accounts to all of its 280 million unbanked population.
Proprietary data from individual bank account statements shows that there is
signicant uptake, usage, usage growth, and balance accumulation in PMJDY
accounts. Activity levels increase over time and converge towards those in
non-PMJDY accounts although PMJDY account holders are poorer, unfamiliar
with banking, and undergo no literacy training. The results suggest that
the 2 billion unbanked around the world have unmet demand for banking or
that banking supply can stimulate its own demand.

Data cleaning and analysis.do file

The .do file inspects and cleans the proprietary bank data which contains details of accounts and its transactions.

A) It shows the distribution of transactions according to types - banking transactions, bank charges, interest payments, bulk transactions and miscellaneous.

B) Shows the wuarter-wise transactions in PMJDY and non-PMJDY accounts

C) Quarterwise regresions showing transactions per account, value per account and value per transaction for both PMJDY and non-PMJDY accounts

D) Quarterwise regresions showing active deposits and withdrawals for both PMJDY and non-PMJDY accounts

E) Poisson regressions for number of transactions per account using quarter-wise data

F) Kaplan-Meier survival estimates for the hazard of account becoming active
